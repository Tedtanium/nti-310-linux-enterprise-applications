One of the biggest parts of this set of chapters was Steve's series of epiphanies. They allowed the group to meet up on a more equal level, and discuss how best to proceed from where everyone was at. From here both Erik and Bill were able to make clear just how bad things were in IT operations. From there, a content freeze was discussed that would enable everyone in IT operations to focus on fixing Phoenix - with no additional overhead birthed by unplanned work. From a management perspective, IT operations should now have the ability to throttle incoming work to reduce piling up WIP.
